  </div>
  The Green Thumb is an automatic plant watering system meant for busy people who may not have the time to care for their indoor plants and gardens. Its main components include three AVR128DB28 microcontrollers, a resistive moisture sensor, and a water container with a peristaltic pump controlled by a DC motor.

  </div>
  The FPGA Stopwatch & Timer I implemented in my third year digital design course (ENEL 453), is a culmination of hardware design and programming. Using the Basys3 board and SystemVerilog on Xilinx's Vivado, I integrated a stopwatch and timer for versatile timekeeping. The stopwatch and timer functionalities were programmed separately, later multiplexed, and implemented on the board using a switch that offers an intuitive user interface. Testing and simulations were conducted through the implementation of testbenches, ensuring the accuracy of the stopwatch, timer, and multiplexer modules.
