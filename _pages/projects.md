    **The Green Thumb**
  </div>
  Our product is named “The Green Thumb.” It is an automatic plant watering system meant for busy people who may not have the time to care for their indoor plants and gardens. Its main components include three AVR128DB28 microcontrollers, a resistive moisture sensor, and a wa- ter container with a peristaltic pump controlled by a DC motor. “The Green Thumb” ensures that the plant it is potted with is watered only when necessary, which is determined by the mois- ture sensor, embedded in the plant’s soil. The user may interact with the product by selecting a plant watering type from one of four pre-calibrated options. The product interacts with the user through status lights that display the relative soil moisture level, current plant watering type set- ting, as well as a “currently watering” indicator LED. There is also a speaker which plays a melody when the on-board water container is low on water, detected by a level sensor structure inside the water container. This level sensor structure is based on another resistive moisture sensor, with long copper leads attached to the sensor on one end, while the other ends of the leads are embedded in the water container. Finally, a photoresistor is used to detect if it is night. This sen- sor will override the input from the moisture sensor, disabling the device when darkness is de- tected, to avoid the device producing sleep-interrupting noise at night. By automating watering, needless water wastage is avoided, and the use of energy efficient components make “The Green Thumb” an environmentally friendly product which makes measurable impact towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This product is envisioned to be a low-maintenance, sustainable tool for any busy gardener to implement in their home gardens.
